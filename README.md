# WordWise ‚Äì Your AI-Powered Writing Companion

**Helping students craft clear, compelling documents with real-time, AI-driven guidance.**

## üåü Why WordWise?
Class essays, research papers, scholarship applications ‚Äì students write a *lot*, yet most free tools only catch basic typos.  WordWise gives you a personal writing coach who:

1. Spots mistakes **while you type** (not after you hit *submit*).
2. Explains *why* a change helps, so every edit is a mini-lesson.
3. Stays in one tidy dashboard where you can create, organise, and revisit every document you craft.

The result?  More confident writers and better grades ‚Äì without the pricey subscriptions.
